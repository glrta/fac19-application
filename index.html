                    <p class="p"><span class="topic">‚Ä¶coding?</span> It was not until mid-2017 that the idea of coding hit me. I had just moved to Cambridge and, struggling to move away from the catering industry and to have financial independence, started a part-time job that would allow me to do an online course in front-end web development. Over time, I found myself wanting to learn more with real people. Saved some money and in July this year I joined a part-time course at General Assembly in London. By the end of the 20 classes (focusing on HTML, CSS and a touch of JS), I was completely hooked, but also had realised that I still had a long way to go if I wanted to pursue a career in the field.</p>
                    <p class="p"><span class="topic">‚Ä¶Founders & Coders?</span> During this process, a friend mentioned that the company she worked for had hired entry-level developers fresh from this coding bootcamp that has a good reputation in the area (üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è- her words). It took me by surprise that Founders & Coders had such a clear vision on how to shift the industry through valuing community, inclusion and collaborative learning in a safe space. I felt inspired by the hands-on structure of the programme to be not just someone who can code, but that is also able to contribute to a project with social impact seeing the bigger picture; a developer that can come up with creative solutions, who works better in a team and is striving to give back (and maybe is not the only woman in the group!).</p>
                    <p class="p"><span class="topic">‚Ä¶me?</span> Although my life in Brazil and my life in the UK seem to be worlds apart, doing something with social impact gives meaning to who I am and keeps me motivated. I would love to learn to be a developer while collaborating to the Tech for Better programme as part of the spring cohort, and then give back by helping others do the same.</p>
