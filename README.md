Create a personal website
Create a one-page website in HTML and CSS (using some vanilla JavaScript if you’d like) and host it on GitHub Pages. Your commit history should tell a story, and your website must be written by you, and:
Show us with your code who you are
Demonstrate your learning from the prerequisites
Tell us about why you are applying for the programme
Contain a link back to the GitHub repo that contains the code for your site
Contain links to your freeCodeCamp (please make sure that your profile is public) and Codewars pages
Include an image carousel (the image carousel must be built into your website, a link to a separate page or CodePen will not be accepted)
Be hosted on Github
Not use a GitHub theme
Not use any JavaScript or CSS libraries like Bootstrap or jQuery or use an image carousel package like Flickity ⁠— we want to see your own code.
